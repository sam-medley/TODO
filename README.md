# TODO
repository for an interactive web application that functions as a Sumikko Gurashi themed todo list.

Will be coded in html, css, and javascript. No framework(we could migrate to REACT later on). 
Reccomended tools: VS Code, github, live preview extension, github extension, bootstrap, postgresql, github copilot, jupyter notebook.   

There can be 2 pages for the application. A character selection page and the game page(contains todo list). A login page can possibly be implemented. 
User information can be stored in a postgresql database. 

**Todo list Functions:**
1. Add function that allows the user to add a custom task.
2. Remove function that removes the users task.
3. Clear function that removes all tasks.
4. Complete function allows you to assign a task as complete which will have the task removed from the users list.

A completed task will reward the user with coins. Coins can be used for buying supplies for your Sumikko Gurashi character.

**Character selection**
1. The user can select a character from Sumikko Gurashi as their pet. 
2. A submit button will confirm the character selection and bring the user to the game page. 
3. They must feed their character every 24 hours otherwise it will die.
4. Food can be bought from the supply store with coins earned from completed tasks.
