This will be the main page for the application. 

The user will be able to add/remove tasks. The users character will also be displayed on this page. 

**what needs to be added**
- create a bank object for storing user currency
- have an integer in the bank object increase when a task is removed. This will be used as the users currency
- have the delete buttons remove the task without incrementing bank object
- add css trash bin animation for delete buttons
- fix bug where delete buttons stay on when a new task is added. This can be done by locking the task input until the user clicks edit again. 
- draft a css design for the page
